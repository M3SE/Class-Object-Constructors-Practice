# Class-Object-Constructors-Practice

## Bank Account
- Create a class called "BankAccount" that has two attributes - a bank account balance and an account holder's name. Create a constructor that can accept both attributes as the parameters.

 

- Create 3 methods within the class.

  - A deposit() method that has an amount of money to deposit as the parameter. Add that amount to the account balance.
  - A withdrawal() method that has an amount of money to withdraw as the parameter. Subtract that amount from the account balance.
  - A method that can print the account details to the console (name whatever you want or attempt to override the toString() method if you'd like to learn something new) - account holder's name and balance
 

- Create a class with a main method where you instantiate a BankAccount object with 500 dollars. Deposit 100 dollars into the account and then print the account details to the console.

## Bank Transfer
- Using the same classes you created in the last lesson, create two accounts. Create the first account with 5000 dollars and the second account with 300 dollars. Withdraw 100 dollars from the first account and deposit 100 dollars in the second account using the methods created in the BankAccount class.

## Product 
- Create a class called "Product" that has three attributes - the product cost, the quantity of product to purchase, and the product name. Create a constructor that can accept all 3 attributes as the parameters.

 

- Create 2 methods within the class.

  - A totalCost() method that prints the total cost when multiple products are purchased.
  - A printProduct() method that prints how much one unit of the product costs and how many units were purchased.
 

- Create a class with a main method where you instantiate a Product object with a product that comes to mind and then call the printProduct() and totalCost() methods in the class.
